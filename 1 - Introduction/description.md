# Intro to DataWeave

Welcome! And thanks for joining us on the path to learn DataWeave.

Throughout this tutorial we will cover the basic concepts behind our language, our key features, and ways of working with common data structures, such as arrays, objects and strings.

We will be reviewing technical concepts, sharing examples and then challenging your new knowledge with exercises.

That's why you'll find an interactive DataWeave editor on the right side of your screen, along with it's output panel to show what the script is producing (including errors).

For each exercise, we will be starting with a working script and asking you to achieve a certain output. You'll see the output update as you write your code, so feel free to play with it for as long as you need to get the desired outcome.

We hope you enjoy the tutorial!
