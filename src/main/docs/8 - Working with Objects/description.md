# 8 - Working with Objects

On this final tutorial we will cover the most common DataWeave functions you will need to work with Objects. It's important to note that, given the nature of Objects, *keys and values* will take center stage now instead of the simple values we've gotten used to with Arrays.

We will start with a brief review of `filterObject`, used to remove key-value pairs from an Object based on some criteria much like `filter` is used in Arrays.

We’ll then discuss `mapObject`, which is used to transform every key-value pair into something else.

And finally we’ll finish with `pluck`, a function that goes from Objects to Arrays.
