# 7 - Working with Arrays

This tutorial will cover the most common DataWeave functions you will need to work with Arrays.

We will start with a brief review of `filter`, used to remove items from an Array based on some criteria. Since this function was covered in the last tutorial, we’ll take this opportunity to learn about type signatures for functions.

We’ll then discuss `map`, which is used to transform every item in an Array into something else.

We’ll follow up with `distinctBy`, and `groupBy`, which can be used to eliminate duplicates in an Array and group like-kind items together, respectively.

We’ll finish with `reduce`. `reduce` is unlike the other functions because of how general-purpose it is. It’s so general that it can satisfy more use cases than all the other functions in this tutorial combined.
