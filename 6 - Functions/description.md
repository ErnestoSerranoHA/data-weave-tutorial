# Functions

Functions are one of DataWeave’s most important tools. They allow us to conveniently reuse functionality and create functionality on the fly when reuse isn’t necessary. In this section we will cover this topics around functions:

* Named functions
* Lambdas
* Passing functions to other functions
* Calling 2-arity functions with infix notation
* $, $$, $$$ syntax
