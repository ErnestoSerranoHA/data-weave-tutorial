# Reading Data

In the previous tutorial, we reviewed how you can create data using Strings, Number, Arrays, and Objects. Creating data is only half of DataWeave, however; reading data is just as important, and the features available to do so are just as robust. With these selectors you can navigate any combination of Objects and Arrays to get to the data you need:

* Single-value selector: `.`
* Index selector: `[n]`
* Range selector: `[n to m]`
* Multi-value selector: `.*`
* Descendants selector: `..`

You can also think of selectors as a way to query your data.
